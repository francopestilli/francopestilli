# Franco Pestilli ðŸŒ±

## I am a professor at The University of Texas at Austin interested in Psychology, Neuroscience and Data Science.

#### I work in a Public University because I believe in science and education. I like to think that by teaching young minds how to think critically and how to use cutting edge tools, like coding, we can make the world a better place. It is not a simple task, but I believe we can.
