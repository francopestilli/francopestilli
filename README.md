# Franco Pestilli ðŸŒ±

## I am a professor at The University of Texas at Austin interested in Psychology, Neuroscience and Data Science.

#### I am from Rome and I am here because I believe in science and education and I would like to think that by teaching young minds how to think critically and cutting edge tools, like coding, we can make the world a better place. It is not simple, but I believe we can make the world better.
